# **Stream to YouTube Dashboard Using RTMP Protocol – Android, Jetpack Compose & Foreground Service**

This project demonstrates how to publish a live stream to YouTube using the RTMP protocol in Android. The system consists of the following key components:

**RTMP Protocol** – Used for real-time streaming to platforms like YouTube.

**Foreground Service** – Keeps the stream running even when the app is in the background.

**Android Client** – A mobile app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

**YouTube Dashboard Streaming Key** – The key used for streaming to YouTube.
